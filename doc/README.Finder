RPS's Finder Package
====================

rps-help@cs.northwestern.edu

Finder implements RPS component lookup, helping a client to find an
appropriate server that can find the needed information.  Currently,
it is quite primitive.  This will change with the next release.
Finder is necessary in order to build RTA and RTSA.
