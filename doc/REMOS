RPS and Remos
=============

rps-help@cs.northwestern.edu

A very early version of RPS shipped with (and still ships with) the
CMU Remos system, which is available from
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~remos.  That early version is named "PPS".
This current RPS version has been tested with the current, 2.0,
release of Remos.

The current interactions between RPS and Remos are the following:

1. RPS's GetFlowBW sensor is based on Remos
2. Remos's modeler can talk to an RPS host load measurement and
prediction system (start_hostloadmeasure.pl, start_hostloadpred.pl) 
to get host information.
3. Remos's modeler can talk to RPS's pred_reqresp_server to get
one-off predictions.

Future interactions are planned.  These are described in

Peter Steenkiste, and Dean Sutherland, The Architecture of the Remos
System, 10th IEEE Symposium on High-Performance Distributed Computing
(HPDC'01), IEEE, August 2001, San Francisco.
