Running RPS
===========

rps-help@cs.northwestern.edu

What it means to "Run RPS" is more complex that might be expected.  A
typical RPS build generates about 10 libraries and over 60
executables, not to mention another 20+ scripts.  Generally speaking,
one runs RPS by either running Prediction Components (ie, those codes
produced from the PredComp package) and Scripts (from the Scripts
package).

Setup
-----

First set the environment variable RPS_DIR to the root of your RPS
tree.  The assumption here is that you are using an sh-derived shell.

export RPS_DIR=/home/pdinda/RPS-development

Next, export your OS and architecture:

export RPS_OS=LINUX
export RPS_ARCH=I386

Next, edit build/setup_rps_env as appropriate for your environment.
Then source it:

source build/setup_rps_env


Host load measurement
---------------------

Start up the measurement system on this host:

start_hostloadmeasure.pl

Get a measurement:

get_measurements_on.pl host

shut down the measurement system:

kill_hostloadmeasure.pl

Notice that there are also _on and _list versions of these scripts.


Host load prediction
--------------------

Start up the prediction system on this host:

start_hostloadpred.pl

Get a prediction:

get_predictions_on.pl host

shut down the measurement system:

kill_hostloadpred.pl

Notice that there are also _on and _list versions of these scripts.


Java GUI
--------

Display measurements and predictions on a host:

run_gui_on.pl host



Use the individual components
-----------------------------

Consult README.PredComps and the RPS technical report.
