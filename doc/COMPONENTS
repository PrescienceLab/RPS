RPS Packages
=============

pdinda@cs.northwestern.edu

RPS is a collection of packages that can be used at several
different levels.  

At the highest level, there is a package containing a scripts that
construct measurement, prediction, and wavelet systems at run-time.

At the next level, the individual executables (components) within the
various RPS packages can be used separately or tied together using
various protocols.

Finally, for most packages, the core functionalty is available as a
C++ include file and library.  The structure of a package is described
in the file STRUCTURE.

The following are the RPS packages.  For more information, consult
README.package_name. 


High-level Performance and Scheduling Advisors
==============================================

RTA

Running Time Advisor.  Predicts the running time of tasks.


RTSA

Real-time Scheduling Advisor.  Predictive scheduling of tasks with
deadlines. 



Scripts
=======

Scripts 

This contains the scripts to do host load measurement and prediction,
and to wrap measurement, prediction, and wavelet services around
existing programs.  Also scripts for static and dynamic plotting of
information from these services.


ResearchScripts

Scripts for research (not usually distributed with RPS)



Signal Processing Packages and Offline Analysis
===============================================

FracDiff

Fortran implementation of the fractional ARIMA predictive model.


TimeSeries

Extensive time-series prediction library and offline prediction tools.


Wavelets

Tsunami: An extensive wavelet analysis library and offline tools.
(see tsunami-tr.pdf for more information)


Trace

Interface library and coversion between different trace formats.


Communication and RPS Components
================================

Finder

Simple interface to find RPS measurement and prediction sources. 
This is currently very primitive


Mirror

C++ template library to implement communication for RPS prediction
components.  Please see the RPS technical report for more information.


PredComp

Prediction components.  Executables that can interconnected to form
measurement, prediction, and wavelet systems.


RPSInterface

Serializable objects and other elements of the interfaces between RPS
prediction components.

Display
=======

JavaGUI

Simple scrolling display of measurements and predictions.


Scripts

(Scripts includes various plotting utilities, plot*)


Web

A web interface suitable for use with Apache


Sensors
=======

GetFlowBW

Sensor (based on Remos) for measuring network bandwidth along a path.


GetLoadAvg

Sensor for measuring host load.


Proc

Sensors for the Linux /proc filesystem.


Sensors

Shared elements of RPS sensors.


WatchTowerRPS

RPS Sensor for Windows performance counters.



Other
====-


Extra

Other items (may not be distributed with RPS)


RemosInterface

Simple C interface to some elements of RPS (used by Remos)


ResearchTools

Executables for research (not usuaully distributed with RPS)
