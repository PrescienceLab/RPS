Using RPS
=========

rps-help@cs.northwestern.edu

In addition to binaries, which are described in RUN and
README.PredComp and other files in the doc directory, an RPS build
also includes libraries and include files for most of its packages.
These can be used to build your own RPS programs.  

The RPS technical report describes how to use the Sensors, TimeSeries
and Mirror packages to build new components.

TimeSeries is intended to itself be extensible with additional models.
