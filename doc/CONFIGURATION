Understanding Makefile.conf
===========================

rps-help@cs.northwestern.edu

This file is intended to be read after BUILD.  It describes the
additional software requirements and Makefile.conf options for each of
the packages. 



Things You Must Set
-------------------

RPS_DIR = your RPS installation directory
CC      = your C++ compiler
F77     = your Fortran 77 compiler if you have one
AR      = your library archiver
RANLIB  = your ranlib 
LD      = your linker
STRIP   = your strip tool
JAVA    = your java compiler
JAVAH   = your java JNI header generator (javah)

OPTIMIZE = YES | NO
DEBUG    = YES | NO

ARCH     = your archtecture 
OS       = your operating system


What to set if you only have GNU Make and a C++ compiler
--------------------------------------------------------

RPS_DIR, CC, AR, RANLIB, LD, STRIP, OPTIMIZE, DEBUG, ARCH, OS

Then

HAVE_GETLOADAVG = YES
HAVE_GETFLOWBW = YES
 HAVE_REMOS = NO
HAVE_WATCHTOWER = YES
HAVE_PROC = YES
HAVE_TIMESERIES = YES
 HAVE_PVM = NO
HAVE_WAVELETS = YES
HAVE_FRACDIFF = NO
HAVE_MIRROR = YES
 HAVE_EXPAT = NO
HAVE_RPSINT = YES
HAVE_REMOSINT = YES
HAVE_PREDCOMP = YES
HAVE_JAVAGUI = NO
HAVE_SPIN = YES
HAVE_TRACE = YES
HAVE_RTA = YES
HAVE_RTSA = YES
HAVE_FINDER = YES
HAVE_RESEARCHTOOLS = NO


GetLoadAvg
----------

HAVE_GETLOADAVG = YES | NO
  Whether to build GetLoadAvg

USE_UPTIME = YES | NO
  Whether to use /bin/uptime to get load averages or a kernel call


GetFlowBW
---------

HAVE_GETFLOWBW = YES | NO
  Whether to build GetFlowBW 

HAVE_REMOS = YES | NO
  If remos exists (library doesn't work if you don't have it)

REMOS_DIR = Remos installation directory

WatchTowerRPS
-------------

HAVE_WATCHTOWER = YES | NO
  Whether to build WatchTowerRPS (Windows monitoring)

Proc
----

HAVE_PROC = YES | NO
  Whether to build Linux /proc monitoring tools


TimeSeries
----------

Note that Numerical Recipes is no longer required

HAVE_TIMESERIES = YES | NO
  Whether to build TimeSeries

HAVE_PVM = YES | NO
PVM_DIR  = directory of PVM 3.3.3 or later installation
PVM_ARCH = pvm architecture symbol
  PVM is required to build the parallel cross validation system
  It is normal for a make depend to complain about missing pvm includes
  if this is set to NO, even if you aren't building the crossval* stuff
  if you are in doubt, say NO


FracDiff
--------

HAVE_FRACDIFF = YES | NO
  Whether to build the FracDiff library (used to implement ARFIMA models)
  Notice that you need a fortran 77 compiler (f77) to build this


Wavelets
--------

HAVE_WAVELETS = YES | NO
  Whether to build the Tsunami library and tools


Mirror
------

HAVE_MIRROR = YES | NO
  Whether to build the Mirror template library and tools

HAVE_EXPAT     = YES | NO
EXPAT_DIR      = directory of expat installation
  Limited XML serialization support - SAY NO

RPSInterface
------------

HAVE_RPSINT = YES | NO
  Whether to build the RPS interface library
  Almost always yes

RemosInterface
--------------

HAVE_REMOSINT = YES | NO
  Whether to build the Remos interface library
  Almost always yes

PredComp
--------
HAVE_PREDCOMP = YES | NO
  Whether to build the prediction components
  This will almost always be yes


JavaGUI
-------

HAVE_JAVAGUI = YES | NO
  Whether to build The Java GUI
  You must have a recent JDK in order to build this
  The JNI interface is built assuming gcc is being used

JDK_CFLAGS = -I flags that point to your jdk's JNI includes

Spin
----

HAVE_SPIN = YES | NO
  Whether to build the Spin library and tools


Trace
-----

HAVE_TRACE = YES | NO
  Whether to build the load trace access tools and playback tool

RTA
---

HAVE_RTA = YES | NO
  Whether to build the Running Time Advisor and testing tools


RTSA
----

HAVE_RTSA = YES | NO
  Whether to build the Real-time Scheduling Advisor and testing tools


Finder
------

HAVE_FINDER = YES | NO
  Whether to build the Component finder library


ResearchTools
-------------

HAVE_RESEARCHTOOLS = YES
  Whether to build various research tools
