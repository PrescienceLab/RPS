RPS Environmental Variables
===========================

rps-help@cs.northwestern.edu

RPS components use the following environmental variables.  
Many variables are set by $RPS_DIR/build/setup_rps_env


Simplified Configuration for Installed RPS
------------------------------------------

If you did a simplified installation of RPS (make install), then
$RPS_INSTALL_DIR/ENV is a customized, bash-specific, environment that
you can simply source in your .bashrc.


General Approach To Setting Variables
-------------------------------------

In your .bashrc or .cshrc, set RPS_DIR, RPS_ARCH, RPS_OS and source
$RPS_DIR/build/setup_rps_env edit $RPS_DIR/build/setup_rps_env if
needed.

Required Variables
------------------

RPS_DIR 
 The home directory of RPS

RPS_ARCH
 The archtiture RPS is running on (I386,SUN,ALPHA)

RPS_OS
 The operating system RPS is running on (LINUX,FREEBSD,WIN32,CYGWIN,DUX,SOLARIS)

RPS_WELL_KNOWN_HOST
RPS_WELL_KNOWN_PORT
 A host and port that RPS can make a one-time request to.

PATH
 You should put $RPS_DIR/Scripts:$RPS_DIR/ResearchScripts:$RPS_DIR/bin/$RPS_ARCH/$RPS_OS
 on your path.


TCP Communication Ports Used By RPS Scripts
-------------------------------------------

$RPS_DIR/build/setup_rps_env will set the following variables.  
They are used by the RPS scripts when instantiating prediction pipelines
using TCP communication:

HOSTLOADPREDCTRLPORT=5000
HOSTLOADPREDBUFFERPORT=5001
SPINSERVERPORT=6000
HOSTLOADPREDCTRLPORT_MEAN=5050
HOSTLOADPREDBUFFERPORT_MEAN=5051
HOSTLOADPREDCTRLPORT_LAST=5100
HOSTLOADPREDBUFFERPORT_LAST=5101
HOSTLOADSERVERCTRLPORT=5150
HOSTLOADSERVERBUFFERPORT=5151
HOSTLOADMEASUREBUFFERPORT=5201


Optional Variables
------------------

LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 Add $RPS_DIR/JavaGUI if you want to use the java gui tool

RPS_NEWSTYLEOUTPUT
 If this variable exists, RPS will print using the new lisp-style output
