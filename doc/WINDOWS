RPS and Windows
===============

rps-help@cs.northwestern.edu

There are two ways to build RPS on windows.  The first is to build it
under Cygwin (www.cygwin.org), in which case building and using it
will look exactly as it does under a Unix environment.  Furthermore,
everything will be built that is enabled and has the appropriate
support software available.  The second way is to build it natively
using visual studio, in which case the build process is entirely
different and a number of things are currently NOT built.

At this point, the native windows build is intended to serve mostly as
a client.

To build natively using visual studio

0. set RPS_DIR=your rps directory
   set RPS_ARCH=I386
   set RPS_OS=WIN32
1. make sure MSDEV.EXE is on your path and INCLUDE and LIB are set reasonably.
2. build\build_windows.bat

You can install after building by

0. set RPS_INSTALL_DIR=your target dir 
   (other RPS_ vars need to be set)
1. build\install_windows.bat

This will build the debug and release versions of the tools and copy
the debug versions into {lib,bin}/I386/WIN32

You can also build RPS by using the Visual Studio GUI.  The file
"RPS.dsw" in the RPS base directory is the workspace.  There are some
100-odd project (.dsp) files scattered throughout the package
directories.

What follows is a description of the missing functionality in the
native windows build on a package by package basis.
