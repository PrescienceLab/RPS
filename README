This is RPS, a toolkit for building resource prediction systems.  It
is software designed to support the author's research in predicting
the dynamic behavior of distributed computing environments. It is
offered with no guarantees.  RPS is described in considerable detail
in the technical report in doc/rps-techreport.pdf (CMU-CS-99-138).
There are a number of papers on the author's home page that present
research results derived from using RPS.

RPS includes Tsunami, a wavelet toolkit for distributed systems 
written by Jason Skicewicz.  The toolkit and RPS components based on 
it are described in doc/tsunami-techreport.pdf (NWU-CS-03-16)
