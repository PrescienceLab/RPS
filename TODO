Sensors

Wavelets
  => Jason
  => ostream bug with newest g++ compiler.

TimeSeries
  => Wavelet Predictor (sanity check)

Add RPS Banner to all codes

PredComp
  => New tools
    => Low pass (Measurement->Measurement
    => look at wavelet_streaming_denoise
    => Wavelet tools to build
      => wavelet_interval_query
      => wavelet_reqresp_server
            Written, compiled, but buggy.  Looks like discrete transforms could also use some work.
            After above converters are written, fixing this should be easy.
      => move generate*delay, etc from ResearchTools/ and ResarchTools/scripts to Wavelets
      => Fix wavelet_reqresp_server - discrete wavelet transform


Windows build env
  => Add new components
     PredComp/wavelet*.cpp; 
   
Test
  => build on windows, cygwin, linux, 


Include Windows GUI?
