Wavelets
  => Give peter copy of compression paper
  => URL for tsunami bannder (tsunami.cs.northwestern.edu)
  => Web page!
  => TR
  => Jason
  => Discrete reverse
  => ostream bug with newest g++ compiler.

TimeSeries
  => Wavelet Predictor (sanity check)
      We don't know yet whether there is any more efficient way to do 
      multistep predictions than just instantiating the structure repeatedly
      currently, the predictor is simply the code that we used in the delay
      amelioration experiments.

Add RPS Banner to all codes
  => perl scripts

PredComp
  => New tools
    => Low pass (Measurement->Measurement
    => look at wavelet_streaming_denoise 
    => Wavelet tools to build
      => wavelet_interval_query
      => wavelet_reqresp_server
            Works for forward.  Reverse waiting on tsunami bug.
            We believe it will work for reverse

Windows build env
  => Decided to only support cygwin
  => Add new components
     PredComp/wavelet*.cpp; 
   
Test
  => build on  cygwin, linux, 


Include Windows GUI?
  => No
